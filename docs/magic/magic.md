# Magic

All magic in Antior is performed by changing the *logical order* of the world. In essence, wielders of the Craft can convince things to act or behave differently, or contrary to the way they are **meant to be**.

## Source

The source of reality on Antior comes from a sourcegate. This sourcegate controls all aspects of reality, and is controlled by the Dominion, an abstract group of higher level, extra-dimensional beings that "maintain" the Universe at large. All things on Antior have a thread that ties them to the sourcegate. It is by this thread that beings are able to use the Craft.

## How it Works

Practitioners of the Craft study for many years to be able to perform even the simplest of tricks. The more one understands the system they are trying to change, the greater affect one can have. Only when one truly understands how a thing works, can it be convinced to be or do something it should not.

## Limitations

The Craft is an exploitation of reality. A practitioner, for all intents and purposes, "hacks" into their thread, giving them a conduit to the sourcegate. This conduit allows them to insert their own logic into the system. However, the greater the change, the more systems the change has an affect on (ripple effect), and the greater the logical inconsistencies with the "natural order," the more likely the practioner is to incur consequences. One set of consequences come in the form of reality glitches, usually directed towards the practitioner. These glitches are usually proportional to the affect being caused. Another, more direct consequence can also be incurred. If the act is too damaging on the System, the sourcegate will retaliate directly. Subtle changes in reality will occur in order to elimate the threat to the system. 

## Daemons

Qire, a member of the Dominion, betrayed their kind, (elaborate on this) and created the race of daemons. Daemons are born of mortal races, but have a special connection to Qire. This connection gives them allowances that normal mortals do not have. They are able to practice the Craft more freely, without consequences, due to their bond with Qire. However, this also means they are eternally bound to Qire, and must serve them. Their primary directive, usually, is to proliferate their species by converting more mortals into daemons.
