The tattered book fell to my desk with a thud, releasing a cloud of dust that made me squint my eyes and cough.

"Yevare, I expected you to have learned this material last semester." My professor, Mr. Palom, eyed me with a discerning look. "If you are planning on falling this far behind, you should just drop out now. We have no use for slackers at The Grand Balisica."

"But professor," I pleaded. Looking down at the book, its worn edges and hand-crafted nature hinting at its age, I realized I had never hated something so deeply.  "I *know* the material. I've read the book front to back at least three times. It's the *application* I struggle with."

Palom leaned down, placing his hands on my desk and arched one eyebrow. "What factor must be applied when performing a posimetric reading of the target?"

"Empathic," I answered without hesitation.

"What about compository?"

"Angathic."

He straightened, stroking his short goatee. "Indeed."

"Sir, I understand the theory. I just... can't seem to feel the thread." I tried to keep the desperation out of my voice, but I'm pretty sure I failed. He didn't understand how badly I needed to become a Magi.

"Have you been meditating?" He asked.

"Every evening, for an hour." I hesitated, then said, "Sir, is it possible that... I don't have a thread?"

Palom barked a laugh, then paced towards his desk, arms behind his back. "Impossible. If you were a Dim, you would not have made it this far. When someone is cut from their thread, it is quite obvious to the trained eye. You, Yevare, still have your thread. It takes a great deal of concentration and practice to feel it though. You must keep practicing. For some, that first step is the most challenging. The more you do it, however, the easier it will become."

"I understand, sir, but---"

"However," Palom continued, "These things are not to be taken lightly, Yevare. There is a reason Verimancy, or the Craft, is so difficult, and a method to the study of these theorems. The danger in misusing the Craft without fulling understanding the consequences can result in terrible outcomes. Death, if you're lucky. Worse, if you aren't."
