As the Atuns of the Age of Legend died off, they could no longer be worshiped as avatars of gods. Instead, The Church of the Triumvirate was founded, as well as the Caeteran religion . Caeteran beliefs revolved around combining Teldur \u2014a mutation of Teth \u2014, Ilris , and Nilos . Caeteran doctrines helped to guide the people of Valmere into a new age of civilization. For many years, human civilization continued to push back the wilds. The greatest kingdom that came to power during this Era was Raeth . The Raethans spread across some seventy-five percent of Valmere during their height, building cities that have lasted even into the modern era. Their Magi, who were a part of a collective known as the Veritas Guild , created technological wonders with Entra the likes of which the world had never seen. Flying machines, ways to travel thousands of miles in mere days, and their greatest creation: the Aeternians . These advancements allowed the Raethans to become a major power in Valmere, with the Veritas Guild at the seat of power. The Raethans ruled for millennia, until the Eternal War . The Aeternian uprising caused a world war to break out, laying waste to much of civilization. The war raged for over a hundred years, causing much of human civilization\u2019s progress to halt and regress. In an event known as The Excidium , nearly all Aeternians vanished from Valmere, and the Veritas Guild disbanded, most Magi going into hiding, causing the realms of Raeth to collapse. The Excidium is also attributed to the loss of Entra in Valmere, and also marks the beginning of The Dark Age .

The world began to calm somewhat, and more stable civilizations were established. Thus, the Age of Balance began. It was during this Era that religion began to shift. As the Atuns of the Age of Legend died off, they could no longer be worshiped as avatars of gods. Instead, The Church of the Triumvirate was founded, as well as the Caeteran religion . Caeteran beliefs revolved around combining Teldur \u2014a mutation of Teth \u2014, Ilris , and Nilos . Caeteran doctrines helped to guide the people of Valmere into a new age of civilization. For many years, human civilization continued to push back the wilds. The greatest kingdom that came to power during this Era was Raeth . The Raethans spread across some seventy-five percent of Valmere during their height, building cities that have lasted even into the modern era. Their Magi, who were a part of a collective known as the Veritas Guild , created technological wonders with Entra the likes of which the world had never seen. Flying machines, ways to travel thousands of miles in mere days, and their greatest creation: the Aeternians . These advancements allowed the Raethans to become a major power in Valmere, with the Veritas Guild at the seat of power. The Raethans ruled for millennia, until the Eternal War . The Aeternian uprising caused a world war to break out, laying waste to much of civilization. The war raged for over a hundred years, causing much of human civilization\u2019s progress to halt and regress. In an event known as The Excidium , nearly all Aeternians vanished from Valmere, and the Veritas Guild disbanded, most Magi going into hiding, causing the realms of Raeth to collapse. The Excidium is also attributed to the loss of Entra in Valmere, and also marks the beginning of The Dark Age .

During this Era, the first humans appeared in Valmere, mainly as hunter-gatherer tribes until the formation of Imperial Cults . These Imperial Cults were generally always in some state of war as they fought over the land and resources, each fervently loyal to their Atun . The Age of Balance ( BE , ~3,000 years) The Age of Balance marks the rise of the first coordinated human civilizations, the largest of which was the Raethani Empire and the Veritas Guild . Many technological wonders were created using Entra during this Era. The Dark Age ( DE , ~500 years) The Dark Age was a short Era proceeding the fall of the Raethan Empire and the Veritas Guide , and the loss of Entra . Much of the technological progress during the Age of Balance was lost or destroyed during this time as the remnants of human civilization vied for power. The Sovereign Age ( SE , 1678 years) Out of the ashes of the Dark Age rose a collective of city-states, that, in a tentative alliance, formed the Sovereignty . This collective remained in relatively peaceful stablity until the formation of the Kadoran Empire some 1500 years later, and the War of Faith , causing the Divergence , the breaking of Sovereignty.
